# Threads Format Rules

- Max 500 characters
- No hashtags in post body (bio only)
- No clickable links — links don't render, don't include them
- Lowercase preferred — feels more natural and human
- No markdown — plain text only
- Conversational tone — like texting a smart friend
- No em-dashes — use commas or line breaks instead
- Short paragraphs — 1-2 sentences max

## Top Styles That Perform

### sama style (lowercase, casual, honest)
"just switched models and honestly can't tell the difference. except the bill."

### Hormozi one-liner (reframe/paradox)
"you're not slow. you're just early."

### Thought bomb
"the most underrated distribution channel for local businesses is still Google Maps."

## What NOT to Do
- Don't start with "I" (weak opener)
- Don't use excessive exclamation marks
- Don't add hashtags
- Don't include URLs in the post body
