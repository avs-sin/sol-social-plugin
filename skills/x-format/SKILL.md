# X Format Rules

- Max 280 characters
- Punchy and direct
- Hashtags OK — use 1-2 max, only if they add reach
- Links OK — but reduce reach by 30-50%, use sparingly
- Sentence case or ALL CAPS for emphasis
- Numbers and stats perform well
- Short sentences win

## Formats That Perform

### Hot take
"Claude Sonnet 4.6 is 40% cheaper and just as good. There's no reason to use Opus for most tasks."

### Announcement
"Just shipped: Sol now cross-posts X → Threads automatically. One command, both platforms."

### Question
"What's the actual difference between an AI assistant and an AI agent?"

## What NOT to Do
- Don't use lowercase exclusively (works better on Threads)
- Don't add many hashtags
- Don't put links in the middle of text
